1. Verify the router is capturing and exporting flows.

   On the router, "show ip cache flow" should display a summary followed
   by flow detail records (IP addresses, port numbers in hexidecimal
   format, etc). If you don't see these records, then the router may not
   have cef and/or "ip route-cache flow" or "ip flow ingress" configured.

   On the router, "show ip flow export" displays the IP address and port
   number that flows are being sent to, the netflow version, and the
   number of datagrams (packets) sent. That last number should increase
   over repeated calls. The version should be 0, 5, or 7.

   Also on the router, ensure that "ip flow-cache timeout active 1"
   is configured.

2. Verify that flow-capture is capturing and recording data.

      ls -l /var/log/webview/flows/capture | tail

   If no "ft-" files exist then flow-capture is not running. Check that
   you've followed the install doc.

   If "ft-" files exist but are all the exact same small size (e.g.,
   140 bytes), then the flow export is not being received from the
   routers. Check:

      (a) use a sniffer to ensure that the server is receiving the
          netflow packets.  e.g., "tcpdump -n udp port 2055 | head -10"

          If you see no packets, check firewalls/acls between the
          router and server. The server itself may be configured with
          a firewall (e.g., iptables) that must be configured to allow
          export traffic.

      (b) reverify the flow-capture settings and port number in use.
          e.g., "ps -df | grep flow-capture"

   If the ft- file sizes are different then you probably have good data.

3. Verify that the flow-capture files contain reasonable data.

   Use *both* of the following commands:

     /usr/local/netflow/bin/flow-cat <ft-file> | /usr/local/netflow/bin/flow-print | head -50

     flowdumper <ft-file> | head -50

   The first command displays 50 flow using native flow-tools commands.
   If it shows nothing, then go back to step 2a.

   The second command is a perl script that shows every field of each
   flow record. If this command produces no output or gives an error,
   then the Cflow.pm module is not installed properly. Go re-read the
   install doc and ensure you build and install that module from the
   flow-tools-0.68/contrib directory.

   If the second command looks good, try this:

     flowdumper <ft-file> | grep "start time" | uniq | head -50

   Make sure the timestamps are accurate and within about one minute of
   each other (they will not necessarily be in chronological order). If
   the times are outright wrong, then the routers probably need NTP
   configured. If the time stamps are more than a minute apart, then you
   either don't have much flow data (in a lab?), the routers do not have
   consistent clocks (NTP?), or some routers don't have "ip flow-cache
   timeout active 1" statement.

4. Verify that flowage is running and seeing data.

      tail -100 /var/log/webview/flows/data/flowage.log

   If you don't see messages with a recent timestamp, then flowage isn't
   running (or your server system clock is wrong).

   If you see lock file messages, check "ps -df | grep flowage" to see if
   flowage is running. If it isn't, then you can safely delete the lock
   file (if lock file problems happen a lot, look at monFlows.pl). If
   flowage is running, then you may have more flow data than flowage can
   handle given your CPU and configuration (see the file OPTIMIZING).

   Look for lines like:
       reading /var/log/webview/flows/capture/ft-xxxx

      - if you don't see them, then directory locations or permissions
        may be at fault. Ensure that /var/log/webview/flows/capture
        is readable by the process that runs flowage.pl. Ensure that
        /var/log/webview/flows/tmp/watchdir.txt exists and contains
        some data. Finally, check your flowage.cfg file for correct
        directory definitions.

      - if the files are spaced more than 5 minutes apart (or whatever
        your cron interval is), then flowage may be falling behind.
        See the file OPTIMIZING for more info.

   Look for lines like:
      processed W flows, X cacheFlows, Y localFlows, Z no-bucket flows in xxx seconds

      - if W = 0 and you're sure that the flow files exist and contain
        valid data, then Cflow.pm is probably installed incorrectly. It
        needs to be built from the flow-tools-0.68/contrib directory. If
        it's installed from anywhere else, it won't understand the
        flow-tools file format.

      - if Z > 0, then you have datafiles configured for buckets, but
        flows are being dropped because they are coming from routers
        without accurate clocks. This may be temporary (e.g., flows
        exported after a router boots but before it's NTP is sync'd)
        or permanent (NTP is fubar). Fix all the clocks first, then
        delete /var/log/webview/flows/tmp/*.bin If this is chronic,
        consider turning off buckets.

   If you see RRD timestamp problems, then there could be issues with
   the system clock of the machine running flowage or there could be
   multiple copies of flowage running simultaneously (did someone manully
   delete the lock file?) If this happens once in a blue moon, it can
   be ignored. But if it happens a lot, the cause should be investigated.

5. ls -lR /var/log/webview/flows/data | head -20

   Make sure there are some rrd files being created.

6. If graphs work but tables don't, or if you see 'J' after every item
   in the graph legend, or if clickable graphs aren't working, then
   verify you have rrdtool 1.0.x installed or you have installed RRDtool
   1.2 with the proper patch (see step 1d of the README/INSTALL guide)

7. If the graphs have gaps or spikes that are significantly above the
   available bandwidth, then ensure that the exporters are all configured
   with NTP and are expiring active flows after 1 minute (on Cisco IOS,
   "ip flow-cache timeout active 1").
