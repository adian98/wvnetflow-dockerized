Device Netflow Info


*** Flexible Netflow ***

 This applies to newer routers and switches (after 2008).

    flow exporter EXPORTER
     destination <IP of collector>
     source Loopback0
     transport udp 2055

    flow monitor MONITOR
     record netflow-original
     exporter EXPORTER
     cache timeout active 60

    interface Serial0/0
     ip flow monitor MONITOR input
     ip flow monitor MONITOR output

*** Cisco Router ***

  On a Cisco router, an standard netflow config looks like this:

    ip cef
    snmp-server ifindex persist

    ip flow-cache timeout active 1         ! minutes
    ip flow-export version 5
    ip flow-export destination <SERVER IP> 2055
    ip flow-export source Loopback0

    interface Serial0/0
     description Rockford, IL WAN circuit
     ip flow ingress
     ip flow egress

  The example above shows ingress/egress netflow on a *single* WAN interface. Do not use this method on more than one interface of the same router, or you will get duplicate export packets!

  If a router has multiple WAN interfaces (i.e., it is potentially a transit router), then you should instead add ingress netflow to every router interface to get a complete traffic picture. E.g.,

    interface Serial0/0
     description Rockford, IL WAN circuit
     ip flow ingress

    interface GigabitEthernet0/0
     description LAN Core 1
     ip flow ingress

    interface GigabitEthernet0/1
     description LAN Core 2
     ip flow ingress


  Be aware that ingress/egress netflow interacts with router features. For example, ingress netflow will report IP addresses and QoS markings of packets as they are received by the router, *before* any router QoS/NAT policies are applied. Egress netflow reports on what the packet looks like *after* QoS/NAT is applied. This is a subtle difference, but it can lead to QoS confusion if you're not careful!

*** Cisco Catalyst switches ***

  There's lots of legacy baggage below; use flexible netflow if your platform supports it!

  On Catalyst 5000/6000 switches running CatOS, there will be one Netflow
  version 5 export from the MSFC configured just like the router above,
  and a second Netflow version 5 or 7 export from the PFC configured
  in CatOS:

    set mls flow full
    set mls agingtime ip 1                 ! minutes
    set mls agingtime long-duration 64     ! seconds
    set mls nde version 7                  ! or 5 if allowed
    set mls nde <IP of collector> 5555
    set mls nde enable

  On Catalyst 6000 switches running Native IOS, the MSFC export is the
  same and the PFC export is a bit simpler:

    mls netflow
    mls flow ip interface-full
    mls aging normal 32                    ! seconds
    mls aging long 64                      ! seconds
    mls nde sender version 7               ! or 5 if allowed

  Note that Catalyst 6000 Netflow behavior has changed over the
  years. Notably:
     1. Early CatOS Netflow exported physical ifIndexes, while native
        IOS exports the logical.
     2. interface-based 'ip flow ingress' has no effect on MLS flow
        collection or export. This is fixed in SRB/SRC+.

  On Catalyst 4000 switches, the commands are the same as for IOS except
  that all interfaces are automatically turned on so you don't need
  'ip route-cache flow' or 'ip flow ingress'. However, you should add
  the following commands:

    ip route-cache flow infer-fields
    ip flow ingress infer-fields

  On devices that support flexible netflow, the configuration is more,
  well, flexible:


  Note #1: flow-tools accepts versions 1, 5, and 7. For version 9/IPFIX
  (which includes flexible netflow), you must use the flowd collector
  described later on.

  Note #2: if the router/switch runs BGP, netflow can include the
  origin/peer ASN's by using the command "ip flow-export version 5
  [origin-as|peer-as]".

  Note #3: on Catalyst 6000 switches, you can also collect NetFlow statistics
  on traffic that stays within a VLAN (i.e., non-routed), although this
  significantly increases the amount of flow data exported since every
  IP broadcast becomes a flow.

        CatOS: set mls bridged-flow-statistics enable <vlan list>
   Native IOS: ip flow ingress layer2-switched vlan <vlan list>

  Note #4: on Catalyst 6000 switches running CatOS, the PFC export seems
  to use the layer-2 interfaces like "Gig 5/1" while the MSFC export
  uses the layer-3 interface like "VLAN 100". With Native IOS, only the
  layer-3 interfaces are used.

  Note #5: On Catalyst 5000/6000, the MSFC export shows process-switched
  traffic. With the 5000 or 6000/SUP1A, this amounted to the first packet
  of every flow. On the 6000/SUP2 or higher, only traffic that is "punted"
  to the CPU for logging or ICMP errors, or is being routed through by
  the MSFC to a Tunnel or WAN intrerface is exported by the MSFC.

  Note #6: Netflow traditionally works on inbound traffic only. So on
  a given router, you'd enable it on every interface and then you'd be
  sure of capturing all traffic. Newer IOS supports outbound netflow
  ('ip flow egress' or 'ip flow monitor <x> output'). Although this
  is handy if you want netflow collection on a single interface only,
  do not use it when netflow is being collected from more than one
  interface or there is a danger of duplicate flows.

  Notes on performance for Cisco equipment with Netflow:

  On Cisco routers, you can expect a 1-2% increase in average CPU, but
  this varies with how loaded the router currently is and how fast its
  WAN interfaces are. On routers with large ACL's, Netflow can actually
  lower CPU utilization. It's best to monitor CPU utilization with the
  'show proc cpu history' command.

  On the Cisco Catalyst 4000, 6000/SUP2, 6000/SUP32, and 6000/SUP720,
  Netflow is handled outside of the switching path so that it has no
  impact on forwarding performance and only a small impact on main CPU.
  On the Catalyst 4000, you may see %C4K-HWNETFLOWMAN-4-FLOWSLOSTERR
  messages due to it's small Netflow cache. These messages indicate
  that some flows are not being accounted for.  It does not affect
  switch forwarding.

  On older Catalyst 5000 and 6000/SUP1A, Netflow is part of the switching
  path and events like flow storms and flow table memory exhaustion can
  lead to performance problems.


*** Softflowd standalone probe ***

  On the softflowd standalone probe, be sure to use the
  "-t maxlife=60" option to set an active flow timeout of 60 seconds
