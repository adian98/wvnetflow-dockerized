# 'transport' rewrite rules
#
# Each office can be tagged with one or more transports:
#      'Unknown', 'AT&T', 'Sprint', 'MCI', 'VPN', 'Private', 'Tunnel'
#
# The following rules determine the transport for each site. The rules can
# match one or more full or partial router or router#interface. The matches
# are done as case-insensitive regular expressions.
#
# The format of each line is:
#
#     TRANSPORT MATCH [MATCH ...]
#
# I.e., if the router or interface were to match MATCH, then the value of
# TRANSPORT would be inherited.
#
# Lines that begin with blank spaces are considered continuations of the
# previous line.
